# Allies_RL_Prototype
Prototype for ally-based roguelike game

A roguelike centered around gathering unique allies rather than equipment or levels.



TODO FOR DEVELOPMENT:

  * update everything to use model.util.Point class instead of smattering of tuples, arrays, etc.
  * finish lighting controller
  * implement monster prefabs
